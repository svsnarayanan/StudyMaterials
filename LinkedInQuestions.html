Write a program that given n1 1s, n2 2s, n3 3s, n4 4s will output the number of such sequences using all these numbers. 
Output your answer modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).

Given a set of words and a length. You are required to print the words such that the words on each line end almost on the same column and the number of trailing spaces at the end is minimized. 

Given aaa bb cc ddddd and length is 5 print the following output. 

aaa 
bb cc 
ddddd

Let x be any integer in the first array, y any integer in the second. Find min(Abs(x-y)). That is, find the smallest difference between any of the integers in the two arrays. Assumptions: Assume both arrays are sorted in ascending order.

Given a function Rand01Uniform() which generates a random integer number from [0,1] with a uniform distribution, write a function Rand06Uniform() which generates a random integer number from [0,6] with a uniform distribution.

Shuffle massive dataset that can't be placed to memory  
  
Given two linked lists that could potentially have a merge—i.e., at some point during one of the linked lists, the next node is a node in the other list—write an algorithm that determines if two lists merge or not. The lists could also potentially contain a cycle—i.e., an element can loop back around to the head.  

Implement a hashtable and make it thread-safe  

Least common windowing
 
You have bunch of numbers coming in, and a given a window size, how would you save numbers so that you can return number if present in window and provide average for current window.

3 coding Questions in 1 hour :
1) Given a binary search tree and a key, if found return 1 else -1.
2) Given a string find the number of distinct substrings (should optimise time and space complexity)
3) Given a string finf the number of distinct palindromic substrings(should optimise time complexity)

Interview 1:
1) Given a boolean expression find the number of ways to paranthasise it so that it evaluates to true
2) Given n stairs , you climb 1 , 2 or 3 stairs at a time . Find the number of ways to reach the nth step

Interview 2:
1) Given the pointer to the root of the tree and two values val1 and val2 . Find the length of path between the values val1 and val2 in the binary tree. { handle corner cases where both the values are on the same path}

2) Given a mapping between numbers and alphabets . Find the number of ways to decode a sequence of numbers

 eg: a - 21 b - 2 c - 54 d - 5 e -4 f-1     2154     1) ac     2) ade     3) bfc     4) bfde  4 ways to decode 
Interview 3:
1) Given a matrix of 0 s and 1 s Find the number of connected components having 1s

   0 0 1 0 1   0 1 1 0 1   0 0 0 1 1   0 0 1 1 0 
The above matrix has 2 components
constraints: Time complexity O(N) space complexity O(1)

2) Given a tree check if it is a binary search tree or not constraints: space complexity O(1)

Interview 4: (HR+Technical)

1) Asked questions on my resume and challenges faced in my project
2) Showed me wwww.amazon.com page and asked me how to design the backend database so that it supports functions like displaying entire information about a product , its average rating and number of customers who gave each rating etc.

Overall the experience was good and the interviewers were friendly.
